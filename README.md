# Task-tracker
This is a simple task tracker made using python for the Task Tracker project in Roadmap.sh.
You suppose you only need Python 3 to run it, i'm not really sure, i'm just starting with this.
The code runs on the CLI, it will verify if you have a proper JSON file for it to run and if not 
it will create one. You can add, delete, update and list all tasks or by status filters. Tasks 
will have a unique ID, name, description, status (todo, in-progress, done), the time at which it
was created and the time at which it was last updated

message me if anything goes wrong, good task tracking i guess?
